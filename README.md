Iris Flower Classification
Introduction
This project aims to classify iris flower species using the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species based on the provided measurements.

Features
Data preprocessing and exploration of the Iris dataset.
Visualization of data distributions and relationships.
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees).
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

cd iris-flower-classification

2. Install the required packages: You can use pip to install the necessary libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Source
The Iris dataset is publicly available and can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository or downloaded from the Scikit-learn library.
